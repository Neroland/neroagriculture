## [0.0.1-alpha.2] - 2026-07-13

First consolidated alpha of NeroAgriculture — a sci-fi farming mod built on **Neroland Core**,
targeting **MC 26.1.2 and 26.2** on **Fabric, Forge and NeoForge** (the "six cells"). This release
brings the mod from an empty multiloader skeleton to a feature-complete alpha spanning the full
grow-to-fabricate loop, greenhouses, automation, genetics, life support, terraforming, and a cohesive
hand-authored art set.

### Added

**Material catalog and fabrication chain**

- Data-driven **material catalog** with conservative built-in defaults, a discovery scan cap, and
  datapack overrides/blacklist by material id. Server-authoritative, synced to clients.
- The **Essence Extractor**, **Essence Infuser**, **Seed Synthesizer** and **Seed Research Bench**,
  plus material/charged/blank seeds, the five neutral **essences** and **Material Essence**, with
  extracting / infusing / synthesizing / researching / conversion recipes.
- Per-tier **yield curves and yield caps**, progression-gate enforcement at start and completion,
  and an operator diagnostics command (`/neroagriculture catalog list|show|errors|report`).

**Resource crops and grow beds**

- **Resource crops** with eight growth stages, grown on tier **grow beds** (Terran, Industrial,
  Orbital, Colonial, Deepvoid). Right-click a fully grown crop to harvest its essence — the crop
  stays planted.
- Grow beds consume energy + nutrient per growth by tier; Terran is ungated and free.

**Food, alien crops and genetics**

- **Food** and **alien** species crops, food seeds, **Engineered Food** and **Alien Produce**, food
  effects and hybrid signature effects, and synthesizer gating for alien acquisition.
- **Genetics** — deterministic traits, breeding, mutations and pollination via the **Genetics
  Station** and **Pollination Beacon**.

**Greenhouses and growth conditions**

- Sealed **greenhouse** multiblock with cached validation, a dimension-based **environment model**,
  climate/growth-condition evaluation, and per-crop blocked-reason status.

**Automation, fertiliser and life support**

- **Planter**, **Harvester** and **Fertiliser Applicator** area machines with POPIA-safe opt-out
  owner tracking; **Fertiliser Processor** plus speed/yield fertilisers and per-bed dosing.
- **Oxygen Plant / Bioreactor** closed-loop life support with an oxygen-contribution seam.

**Biofuel, essence blocks and crop towers**

- **Biofuel** fluid + **Biofuel Converter** (renewable, below-primary-generation baseload) with a
  provider seam and `c:` energy/fuel tags.
- Compacted **essence blocks** for all five tiers, the finite **Essence Decor** block, and 9↔1
  compression recipes.
- **Crop Tower** controller + frame with virtual-slot batched plant/grow/harvest cycles.

**Seasonal cycles, terraforming and compatibility**

- Datapack-driven **seasonal/stellar cycles** applying growth and yield modifiers.
- **Terraforming** — staged region conversion via the Terraforming Controller + Terraforming Seed,
  with an environment region-override seam.
- **Compatibility** facade (`CompatContracts`) and `c:` discovery tags — every third-party
  integration is dormant-safe when the other mod is absent; NeroAgriculture hard-depends on Core only.

**Visuals and UI**

- A cohesive **"hydroponics lab"** texture set for every block and item (bright composite housing +
  bio-green accent + soil/foliage organics), generated procedurally by `tools/gen_textures.py`; the
  five essence tiers are coloured from the material catalog so art stays in lockstep with data.
- **Eight distinct growth sprites** per crop family (resource / food / alien) as cross models.
- **Layered multi-element 3D block models** for machines, grow beds and the beacon (plinth + inset
  body + console + posts; walled soil trays; column + lens), matching NeroTech/NeroSpace.
- **Per-machine GUI screens** dispatched by machine kind (Extractor / Infuser / Synthesizer /
  Research Bench), each with its own accent and input→process→output diagram.
- **`/neroagriculture gallery`** creative showcase command with a working demonstration **farm**
  (powered + nutrient-fed tier beds growing representative ores) and `gallery clear`.

**Telemetry, docs and tooling**

- Opt-out, anonymous **Sentry** crash reporting (EU ingest) — NeroAgriculture-only filtering, PII
  scrubbing, de-duplication and a per-session cap; toggle with `telemetryEnabled` in
  `config/neroagriculture.properties`. Adds a `PlatformInfo` ServiceLoader seam.
- Full player- and contributor-facing **wiki** under `wiki/`, plus a **wiki sync** GitHub workflow
  that publishes it to the repository wiki.

### Fixed

- **Own creative tab** — NeroAgriculture's items now live in their own creative tab instead of
  Neroland Core's.
- **Block render occlusion** — non-full-cube machines, beds and the beacon are now `noOcclusion`, and
  greenhouse glass uses a dedicated block that culls shared faces against adjacent glass (fixing the
  transparent-model-on-solid-block artefact).

### Notes

- **Privacy (POPIA/GDPR):** all player data is UUID-only, opt-out, and routed through Core's shared
  `PlayerDataErasure` hook; telemetry carries no personal data. See
  [Privacy and erasure](wiki/Privacy-and-Erasure.md).
- **Build:** all six loader×MC cells compile and pass `ecjCheck` and unit tests. Full in-game runtime
  verification across every cell is tracked for a later pass.
